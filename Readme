Below is a Python script that outlines the steps you mentioned. This script covers the automation of the pg_dump process for each database, creates a comparison using Beyond Compare, deploys the script to a test database, and then applies it to the production database.

Pre-requisites:
Ensure that psycopg2 is installed: pip install psycopg2-binary
Ensure that pg_dump and psql are available in your PATH.
Beyond Compare must be installed and available in the system's PATH for automated comparisons.

Python Script:

import subprocess
import psycopg2
from shutil import copyfile
import time

    # Step 6: Wipe out the target DB and run the merged script
    run_psql(production_db_config, merged_file)

Key Enhancements:
Application Offline/Online Notifications: Functions notify_applications_offline and notify_applications_online are placeholders for notifying applications to go offline and come back online.
Handling Additional Data Changes: Steps included to dump the production database before the final deployment and handle additional data changes.
Execution Flow: Ensure that applications are taken offline before major database changes and brought back online after changes are applied.
Note:
Modify the placeholder functions notify_applications_offline and notify_applications_online to include the actual logic for taking applications offline and bringing them back online.
Test the script in a safe environment before running it in production to ensure it works as expected.
Make sure you have necessary backups and permissions to execute these operations on your databases.

Notes:
Beyond Compare: The script assumes that Beyond Compare (bcompare.exe) is available in the system's PATH and can be called directly from the command line. Adjust the command accordingly if you are using a different comparison tool or have a different setup.
Backup: Ensure that you have a full backup of your production database before running any scripts that modify the database.
Database Credentials: For security reasons, consider using environment variables or secure credential management tools instead of hardcoding passwords in the script.
Testing: Always test this script in a non-production environment before applying it to production to ensure it works as expected.
Manual Steps: The script outlines steps to take applications offline and merge additional data changes manually, as these actions may require careful handling specific to your environment.
This script provides a comprehensive approach to managing schema changes across different PostgreSQL environments while ensuring the integrity of your production data.
